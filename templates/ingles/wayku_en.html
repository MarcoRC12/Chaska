        home of the Quechua-Lamista people. Here you will not only learn about
        their traditions, but you will be part of them. Walking through its
        streets, you will hear the ancestral language, see their colorful
        traditional costumes and discover rituals, dances, food and stories
        passed down from generation to generation. If you are looking for
        authentic and transformative tourism, El Wayku is an experience that
        touches the heart."
